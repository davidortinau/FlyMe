# FlyMe Sample App

This is a Xamarin.Forms sample app showcasing the use of Material Design and CollectionView within the new Shell container.

## Material Design with Visual

Visual is a simple API for setting the renderers at any level of your application. In this case, we are using Material Design for iOS and Android to achieve a consistent look and feel.

## CollectionView

CollectionView is a new list control that supports multiple layouts, grouping, incremental loading, empty view state, and much more. 

## Shell

Shell introduces a simplified way to express the navigation UI of your application using flyout items and tabs. Navigation services are available from anywhere in your application, and URI based routing supports passing query strings to easily share state.
